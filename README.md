# civil-assignment
This project is a pretty simple project made in Python with the help of OpenCV.
It is done to find the centroid of the surface given in any specific image. 

The limitation being that the user can provide images which have uniform outline and fill colour, otherwise, it fails.
One more limitation, which can be taken care of but i am just lazy is that, if the image has mutliple surfaces, it will only give centroid of one surface.

The images provided along with the code is just for testing purposes. Any image with a single uniform shape and with as less noise as possible, is cool too.
