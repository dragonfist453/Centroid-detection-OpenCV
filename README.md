# Centroid detection
This project is a simple project made in Python with the help of OpenCV.
It is done to find the centroid of the surfaces in any given image.

The centroids are found individually and also labelled in purple colour. For dimensional reference, the height and width of the image is also displayed. By comparing the relative pixel widths, we can find the original coordinates in our system.

The limitation being that the user can provide images which have uniform outline and fill colour, otherwise, it fails.

The images provided along with the code is just for testing purposes. Any image with a single uniform shape and with as less noise as possible, is cool too.
